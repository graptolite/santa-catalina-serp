The specific directions are difficult to determine without a specification. However, the definition of euler angles requires that two of them take a range over $2\\pi$ radians and the one takes a range over $\\pi$ radian.\n\nOne way of mapping all three angles within one pixel is using RGB bands, such that each band is assigned to rotation about each axis. The colormap reference can then be displayed in a ternary plot. For the RGB bands to work, the angles must be normalized to range [0,1]. To determine the method of normalization, the range of each Euler angle must first be determined. In the absence of a specification in the metadata, this can be performed by inspecting the minimum and maximum data values.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"5a7bfea6-3250-419d-b512-ea33b8e61606","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Euler1 0.0 359.94\nEuler2 0.0 59.163\nEuler3 0.0 359.96"}],"source":["for i in range(1,4):\n    euler_angle = \"Euler%u\" % i\n    data = df[euler_angle]\n    print(euler_angle,min(data),max(data))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"50668cce-4626-49fa-9631-08843ce1d22c","metadata":{},"source":["From this analysis, it seems that Euler1 and Euler3 are the angles with range $2\\pi$ radians between 0 and 360 degrees, and Euler2 is the angle with range $\\pi$ radian between 0 and 180 degrees (though the upper limit does not seem to have been reached, implying non-randomness of the distribution of rotations about the second Euler pole).
