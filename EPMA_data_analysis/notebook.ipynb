Since this web stuff isn't particularly relevant to the science, the specifics of each step will not be discussed in detail (though brief, explanatory comments will be present throughout the code), and the functionality will be wrapped inside a class for easy reusability later on.\n\nThe key thing to know is that `WebmineralQuerier` is a class that's constructed with a composition in dictionary format (element : weight%) and provides the method `order_minerals_df`, which returns an ordered DataFrame of matching mineral compostions within some percentage tolerance.\n\n-   The ordering is done using a summed fractional misfit approach, which uses $\\sum_{elems} \\frac{O-E}{E}$ ($elems$: elements, $O$: \"observed\" weight% in the mineral options returned from Webmineral, $E$: expected weight% from EPMA analysis) to determine the misfit.\n-   If the tolerance is too high, then there will be more results than can be handled, and so the closest match may be outside of the returned results. As such, the tolerance should be set relatively low as such to return only a few results, but not too low such that there's only one result returned.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"dae27755-4ebc-425a-ab96-53679586599c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests as req\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sum_fractional_misfit(observed,expected):\n    ''' Compute row-wise summed fractional misfit values.\n\n    observed | :required: | 2D numpy array containing \"observations\" (element wt% of the different mineral options returned from Webmineral)\n    expected | :required: | 1D numpy array containing the expectation (expected element wt% from EPMA analysis)\n\n    Returns: np.array\n    '''\n    return np.sum(abs(observed - expected)/expected,axis=1)\n\ndef findall_tag_contents(tag,s):\n    ''' Find all tags (+contents) of a certain type/name in a string.\n    tag | :required: | HTML/XML tag type/name e.g. \"i\" for <i>\n\n    returns: list\n    '''\n    return re.findall(\"<%s[\\s\\S]*?</%s>\" % (tag,tag),s)\n\nclass WebmineralQuerier:\n    def __init__(self,compositional_target):\n        '''\n        compostional_target | :required: | EPMA observed composition that's being searched for in dictionary format (element symbol:weight% e.g. {\"Si\":20, ... })\n        '''\n        # Construct parameters string for the composition search query.\n        self.elem_params = \"&\".join([\"sym%u=%s&percent%u=%.2f\" % (i+1,elem[0],i+1,elem[1])\n                                     for i,elem in enumerate(list(compositional_target.items()))])\n        self.target = compositional_target\n        return\n\n    def _get_table(self,tolerance):\n        ''' Get the match for the (html) table of minerals returned from the Webmineral query.\n        tolerance | :required: | the percentage tolerance around the inputted composition.\n\n        Returns: re.Match\n        '''\n        print(\"Querying Webmineral with tolerance %.2f\" % tolerance)\n        # Construct query url.\n        query_url = \"http://webmineral.com/MySQL/mineral_chem.php?%s&minmax=%s&submit=Submit+Query\" % (self.elem_params,tolerance)\n        # Issue GET request to query URL.\n        response = req.get(query_url)\n        # Find the table of results in the contents of the response.\n        table_of_matches = re.search(\"\"\"Listing of [0-9]*?
