  Doesn't seem to be a huge difference in the distribution of grains <0.05 mm<sup>2</sup> area when reconstructing fractured grains - can still interpret this distribution as it's relatively robust.\n    -   However, there are significant differences in aspect ratios, maximum sizes etc.\n-   However, the discussions in `../section-scans-full/working.org` suggest that the amount of automatic gap filling may affect the observed distributions, and so further analysis is necessary.\n    -
