Also, similar to it's actual usage during the project, the code does not become fully automated, requiring manual changes to the sample name (folder) in the function `stitch_full` since the samples were photographed over multiple days. Stitched scans already exist in `./DATASETS/RL_scans/`, so this section is included mostly for completeness.\n\nDue to a lack of Reflected-Light section scanning microscope, manual photography followed by semi-automated image stitching (dependent on `Hugin` - [https://hugin.sourceforge.io/](https://hugin.sourceforge.io/)) was necessary to create Reflected-Light scans for further processing.\n\nThis involved:\n\n1.  Sequential photographing of the section along a path that would cover an area in a snake-path without changing zoom, where there would be overlap between subsequent photos (in a \"column\") as well as overlap between \"columns\" of photos (figure [18](#orgf965b77)).\n    -   These photographs must be taken at constant illumination and exposure, with no change in the white/black balance of the image. It may be necessary to disable auto white/black balance.\n    -   Gamma may need to be changed to produce a significant contrast between reflective and non-reflective grains.\n    -   Camera lens distortion should be negligible such as mosaic stitching is assumed later (i.e. sequential images are just transformed on a 2D plane relative to each other).\n    -   The sequential nature of the photos must be reflected in their filenames. The files must be named in the format `image<4-digit id>.<file extension>`.\n2.  If necessary, converting the images into .jpg format.\n3.  Organising the photographs into multiple folders, each containing just one column of photos (with column folder name format `col<numerical id>`). An example folder structure:\n    -   `<Sample Name>`\n        -   `col1`\n        -   `col2`\n        -   `col3`\n        -   *etc.*\n4.  Running the image stitcher below.\n    -   Note: the final output file won't be named after the sample - it's large size means it isn't the most suitable for long term storage so isn't prioritised as such.\n\n![img](./imgs/section-scanning.png \"Taking pictures for a larger area than one single frame of view using a snaking path (arrow shows direction of sequential photography). Note: 'column' refers to a collection of photos taken sequentially where all photos lie roughly on one axis.
