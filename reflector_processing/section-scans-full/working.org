To test the effect of different degrees of gap filling, this notebook was run with =dilate_erode= set to each of [0,10,20] (where 0, None and False are functionally the same). The results of these are displayed statically in the notebook in tables - however, this requires the notebook to be run with =dilate_erode= set to each of 0, 10 and 20 beforehand.

*** Discussion
[2023-12-06 Wed 15:04]
Observations:
- The main difference between partially and heavily altered is that the heavily altered distributions appear to overall have broader distributions.
- Increasing dilation-erosionn appears to broaden the distributions.
  - This effect is particularly pronounced for M02, a very (?) heavily altered sample.

Interpretations
- Increased alteration increases growth of reflectors, biasing them towards larger sizes.
- Dilation-erosion causes joining of grains that don't get separated by erosion, and hence a general increase in size. This effect should be amplified if there are lots of reflector grain clusters. Therefore M02 likely has a lot of reflector grain clusters.
* Reflector Area vs Nearest Neighbour Distance
On the plots, the area range (x-axis) is hardcoded (to between 0 and 0.05 mm^2), and the nearest neighbour distance is hardcoded (to between 0 and 1 mm).

** Discussion
[2023-12-06 Wed 15:06]
Observations:
- There's a large spread of nearest-neighbour distances for the finest grains; as grains become larger, nearest-neighbour distance appears to converge to a value around 0.1-0.2 mm.
- Increasing dilation-erosion increases the modal separation distance (the peak in the distributions of nearest-neighbour distance).
- There are more larger grains with increasing dilation-erosion, which means the convergence is clearer.

Interpretations:
- Increasing dilation-erosion means grains will generally grow in size, such that a lot of low-separation fine grains become merged, hence the increase in modal separation and spreading out towards larger grain sizes.
* Reflector Aspect Ratios
On the plots, the aspect ratio range (x-axis) is hardcoded (to between 0 and 20).

#+END_EXPORT
** Discussion
[2023-12-06 Wed 15:10]
Observations:
- The modal aspect ratio is nearest to 1.
- Aspect ratios are quite variable within each collection of samples with common degrees of alteration.
- In some cases increasing dilation-erosion broadens the distribution of aspect ratios (07A from 10x10 px to 20x20 px), in others it narrows (07A from no dilation-erosion to 10x10 px), and in others it has little effect (M04, M07B1 with increasing dilation erosion), with this effect being inconsistent.

Interpretation:
- There's probably no confident information that can be extracted from these distributions due to a lack of consistency.

For the area distribution curve fits, and interpretation of the parameters' meanings are:
- $a$: height of the distribution at the start such that $a/n$ is the height normalised by the number of reflectors (to permit comparison between sections). The larger $|a/n|$ is, the taller the start of the distribution relative to higher values.
- $b$: measure of "decay" rate of the negative exponential distribution. The larger $|b|$ is, the narrower the distribution.

Observations:
- There's a narrowing of the range of values towards the smaller end for the largest parameter area with increasing alteration. This narrowing is most pronounced at 20x20 px dilation-erosion.
- The reflector number density appears to also broaden in range with increasing alteration. This effect is clearest without dilation erosion, and is roughly equally less clear for 10x10 and 20x20 px dilation-erosion.
- The reflector coverage density appears to broaden in range with increasing alteration but only clearly so at 20x20 px dilation-erosion.

Interpretation:
- Due to the greater effect of heterogeneity on larger grains, the difference in largest grain sizes can't be confidently interpreted.
- Broadening of number density and coverage suggests that increasing alteration can either have little effect on reflector number density, or can increase it.
- The effect of different amounts of dilation-erosion is relatively important in determining how clear these changes in range are.

Observations:
- $a/n$ generally broadens with increasing alteration. The amount of dilation-erosion has little effect on this.
- $b$ generally decreases lower magnitudes with increasing alteration, with this effect being more pronounced with increasing dilation-erosion.

Interpretations:
- Increasing alteration can change the relative size of the lowest area bin in different directions.
- Increasing alteration generally broadens the area distribution, with this effect being more obvious with increasing dilation-erosion.

Observations:
- These fits aren't great (even ignoring the semilog nature of these plots)

Interpretation:
- A better fit function may be needed - or manually drawing continuous distributions?

Observations:
- There's a relatively consistent observation across the range of dilation-erosions tested that there's a decrease in the proportion of some finer grain size, with an increase in grains just coarser, and that increase decaying with increasing grain size up to ~0.01 mm^2.
  - Where no dilation-erosion is applied, there's an increase in the finest grain size fraction considered, but when 10x10 or 20x20 px dilation-erosion is applied, the finest fraction experiences a significant decrease.

Interpretations:
- The finest grains are dissolved and reprecipitated on other smaller grains to increase their grain size.
  - This is different to the finest grains being preferentially dissolved as that would increase the proportion of all coarser grains.
  - I.e. the decaying increase in grain proportions between ~0.002 and 0.01 mm^6 is likely related to precipitation effects.
** Testing the Robustness of the Difference in Distributions
The difference is distributions can be tested by a bootstrapping method assuming the fitted distributions accurately reflect the parent distribution of the observed distributions:
1. Generate a subsample of each fitted distribution, where the size of each subsample corresponds to the size of the dataset used for each aggregated distribution.
2. Use some statistical method of determining whether two empirical (i.e. discrete) distributions are different to calculate the confidence with this the distributions can be described as different. Some methods identified are described in table [[tab:difference]]. Based on my interpretation of these tests, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test should be the most useful in quantifying whether the distributions are likely different or not. However it's scipy implementation is only valid for continuous distributions /sensu stricto/.
3. Repeat this process of subsampling and comparing many times until a relatively smooth distribution of confidences is produced.

#+RESULTS:

Scipy tests generate a test statistic, as well as a P-value. The null hypotheses for the various tests in the table effectively boil down to "the distributions are the same". In order to reject this null hypothesis, the observed P-value must be below a critical value - this is taken (somewhat arbitrarily) at 0.05. Therefore, in the distribution of P-values (generated by bootstrapping), the percentage of P-values below 0.05 is a proxy for the likelihood that the two distributions (derived from data of almost-certainly unequal sizes) are different.
- To avoid this taking an excessively long time, an undersampling factor is introduced, which reduces the size of both samples by a common factor (through division by the undersampling factor).
- The larger this undersampling factor is, the greater the effect of randomness on the distributions. However, the fundamental nature of the test should remain.
- Regardless, keeping the undersampling factor as close to 1 as feasible is preferred.

Observations:
- Out of all the tests, only the KS-test is able to clearly identify the same distributions as being the same - i.e. peak in p-value distributions at high p (the other tests appear to produce an even distribution of p-values, which suggests the same distributions are equally as likely to be the same as to being different).
  - Therefore, the results of the KS-test are probably the most reliable in this circumstance.
- All tests seem to suggest that the partially vs heavily altered distributions are different for all amounts of dilation-erosion.
  - However, the t-test seems to be quite sensitive to differences in fit shapes produced by different amounts of dilation-erosion.

Interpretations:
- Subsamples of the fitted continuous distributions of the partially vs heavily altered empirical area distributions have a high likelihood of being different. Therefore - assuming the empirical area distributions represent subsamples of their respective fitted continuous distributions - the empirical area distributions are likely different as well.
