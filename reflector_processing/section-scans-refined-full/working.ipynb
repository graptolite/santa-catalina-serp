The effect of this is especially clear when a 20x20 px kernel is used.\n\nSo reduce the effect of randomness, a smaller number of bins can be used when plotting the diagram of focus (i.e. results of processing with the 10x10 px kernel).\n\n![img](./imgs/modified-10-heavily-minus-partially-altered-bins50.png \"50 bins\")\n\n![img](./imgs/modified-10-heavily-minus-partially-altered-bins20.png \"20 bins\")\n\nThough there does seem to be a very approximate decrease in the proportion of finer grains, followed by an increase in the proportion of slightly coarser grains, this effect is not as clear.\n\nThe potentially oscillatory nature of the difference in distributions that \"dampens\" with increasing reflector area may also suggest this is an effect of random variation whose magnitude decreases with lesser observations (i.e. there were many small grains observed so randomness could produce significant variations in the normalised aggregated distributions around the small-area end of the distribution; there were few larger grains observed so even if there was randomness, the smaller numbers within the tail of the area distribution means it would appear smaller on the plot of difference).\n\nOne possible way of testing this hypothesis is by dividing the each bin in the difference graph by the inverse of the sum of the frequencies in the corresponding bin from the area distribution (i.e. such that the resultant metric is effectively a measure of how large the change is relative to how many samples are in the bin).
