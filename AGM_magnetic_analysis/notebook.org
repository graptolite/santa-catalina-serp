#+TITLE: Magnetic Data Analysis
* Introduction
Hysteresis loops, demagnetization curves and first order reversal curve collections were measured on an AGM at Cambridge. This dataset can be used to infer the different types of magnetic domain states within a rock through the production of plots:
- Day Plots \citep{Day1977} - bulk domain state
- FORC Diagrams (e.g. \cite{Roberts2014} - characteristic domain state contents (may contain more than one)
* Day Plots
Day Plots are scatterplots of $H_{cr}/H_c$ against $M_{rs}/M_s$ where $H_{cr}$ is the coercivity of remanence, $H_c$ is the coercivity, $M_{rs}$ is the remanent saturation magnetization, and $M_s$ is the saturation magnetization.

Hysteresis loop measurements provide $M_s$ and $H_c$ (as long as the peak applied field is strong enough to reach saturation magnetization), and DC demagnetization measurements provide $M_{rs}$ and $H_{cr}$. This data can be read from .hys and .dcd files respectively. Coercivity is in the units Tesla and remanence is in the units Am^2.

There appears to be a clear separation between partially (green) and heavily (purple) serpentinized samples, with the partially serpentinized samples plotting more so in the MD region and the heavily serpentinized samples plotting more so in the PSD region.
* FORC Diagrams
This difference is supported by FORC diagrams, which are plotted via FORCinel - code written in a proprietary language that can't be included in a notebook. Python code for plotting FORC diagrams is provided below to demonstrate the relevant equation, but is not the same as the more robust implementation in FORCinel. This code implements the equation for the FORC diagram:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\rho = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 M}{\partial B \partial Br}
\end{equation}

Where $M$ is the magnetization (moment), $B$ is the applied field and $Br$ is the reversal field. $\rho$ is plotted in the $Bi$ vs $Bc$ domain space where $Bi = \frac{B + Br}{2}$ (interaction field) and $Bc = \frac{B - Br}{2}$ (coercivity).

Magnetization data is first parsed into ($B$,$Br$) domain space as a raster-like dataset. This is done by handling each FORC separately (with each FORC having variable $B$ but a single $Br$) and collating data from the full collection of FORCs into a single dataframe.
- Each FORC is smoothed (where there's enough datapoints) using a savgol filter to reduce noise before inclusion in this dataframe.

* FORC Diagram PCA
Raster map PCA was performed using FORCinel, giving rise to 3 principal components of interest for 4 endmembers (Figure [[fig:FORC-PCA]]) that could be combined in various fractions to satisfactorily form the data-derived FORC diagrams.

The degree to which each endmember contributed to the different samples' FORC diagrams was outputted by FORCinel and exported to the table =./local_data/forc_pca_proportions.csv= (with column headers slightly modified). This data can processed to get non-negative percentage contributions by setting negative values to zero and then renormalization.

A clear difference partially and heavily serpentinized samples (between M08B and 07B) can be seen, with partially serpentinized samples being dominated by EM1, whilst heavily serpentinized samples contain appreciable proportions of EM4.

Looking at the endmember FORC signatures (figure [[fig:EM]]), it seems that the partially serpentinized samples are magnetically dominated by MD grains, whereas the heavily serpentinized samples contain more PSD grains. This is consistent with the Day Plot.
