As such, converting from XRF data to T-D composition strings involves separating oxides into their constituent elements and then converting from mass (weight%) to moles (as molar ratios). The method is encoded in the spreadsheet `Composition-Converter-Palin.xlsx` (by Richard Palin), and translated to Python in the class `CompositionProcessor` in `composition_processor.py`. The specifics of the code are not relevant to this notebook, but a brief outline is provided for context (for more detail, see `composition_processor.py`, which contains explanatory comments). The general steps of this method include, where the moles are relative to each other rather than being absolute values (since the composition is in the form of percentages):\n\n1.  Convert oxide weight to oxide moles through dividing by Mr.\n2.  Convert all Fe2O3 into FeO + O (such that it's nominally stored in FeO, but with additional O stored separately that oxidizes the necessary fraction of FeO to Fe2O3).\n3.  If an apatite correction is to be applied (i.e. remove apatite contributions to calcium oxide), then remove a number of CaO moles scaled to the amount of P2O5 observed. P2O5 can also be ignored by passing another option.\n4.  (Not absolutely necessary but useful for inspection of oxide amounts) normalize the total number of oxide moles to 100 (such that the moles of each oxide effectively represents a percentage).\n5.  Find the number of non-oxygen element atoms and oxygen atoms per oxide molecule and then multiply by the *oxide* moles to get the moles of each *element* (including oxygen after summing contributions from all oxides).\n6.  Convert this data into a suitable format for T-D input.\n\nAn brief example of relevant usage is as follows:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"9d73a63f-f639-441a-b626-66dcd73dd835","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"{'SiO2': 52.33199408408726, 'TiO2': 0.010040674229487196, 'Al2O3': 0.8434166352769245, 'MnO': 0.15061011344230793, 'MgO': 37.86338251939622, 'CaO': 0.08032539383589757, 'Na2O': 0.040162696917948784, 'K2O': 0.010040674229487196, 'P2O5': 0.010040674229487196, 'H2O': 0.004, 'FeO': 0.8032539383589757, 'Fe2O3': 7.852732595995978}\nSI(43.95)AL(0.83)CA(0.06)MG(47.40)FE(5.53)K(0.01)NA(0.07)TI(0.01)MN(0.11)H(0.02)O(144.79)"}],"source":["from composition_processor import CompositionProcessor\n\n# Access the (dehydrated) composition of the first sample in the database after removing the totals.\ncomposition = dict(PEM_df_dehyd.iloc[1,:].drop([\"tot\",\"dehyd_tot\"],axis=0))\n\nprint(composition)\n\ntd_formula = CompositionProcessor().theriak_domino_formula(composition)\n\nprint(td_formula)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c57d5897-7dee-4599-ab12-be951f6669d1","metadata":{},"source":["## PEM P-T-x Paths\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d5cb12d3-ac17-4d5e-9a66-bd19d78ed1ba","metadata":{},"source":["The P-T-x path was determined (with some degree of interpretation and simplification) from the literature \\citep{Grove1995,Platt2024}:\n\n-   Cooling Path: 14 kbar, 850 deg C to 14 kbar, 700 deg C\n    -   Composition: dehydrated/mantle water content\n-   Serpentinisation and Exhumation Path: 14 kbar, 700 deg C to 4 kbar, 200 deg C\n    -   Composition: hydrating (rapid increase to near observed water content at the start, and then slower increase to observed water content later in this path)\n-   Final Exhumation Path: 4 kbar, 200 deg C to 1 kbar, 100 deg C\n    -   Composition: hydrated/observed water content\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"99146c61-fea5-44c8-a92b-76e43ec8b6aa","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"None"}],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the paths.\npaths = {\"cooling\":([850,700],[14000,14000]),\n         \"serpentinisation\":([700,200],[14000,4000]),\n         \"exhumation\":([200,100],[4000,1000])}\n\nplt.figure()\n# Plot the paths.\nfor path in paths:\n    plt.plot(*paths[path],linewidth=1.5,label=path)\n\n# Set viewport limits.\nplt.xlim(0,850)\nplt.ylim(14100,0)\n# Set axes labels.\nplt.xlabel(r\"Temperature /$^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Pressure /bar\")\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a4410cae-0592-4799-a9d7-ee0de32a8234","metadata":{},"source":["## PEM Execution\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9d8e99c7-c79b-4f1a-83f6-f5911b5dffb7","metadata":{},"source":["The Python code used to interface with `theriak.exe`, and basic plotting methods for its output are not particularly relevant for the purposes of this notebook, and so are stored in the separate file `theriak_api.py`.
