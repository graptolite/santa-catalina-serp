Since the data for PCA is compositional, standard PCA isn't the best approach. Instead, a \"robust\" approach implemented in `robCompositions` \\citep{Templ2011} is used. This implementation is written in the R language only (with no Python equivalent), so the PCA plotting code will be written in R.\n\nThe installation of `robCompositions` may face a number of hurdles:\n\n-   `cmake` (installable system package) is a prerequisite\n-   `curl-config` (system command) is a prerequisite and may be found in the installable system package `libcurl4-gnutls-dev`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"ecbd7c5d-f0b1-4de2-8c54-7db9c07ad03f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["library(robCompositions)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nextract_cols <- function(dataf,cols){\n  #' Isolate columns from a dataframe by removing all other columns.\n  #'\n  #' dataf | :data.frame: | Dataframe with a set of columns that encompasses those in cols.\n  #' cols | :chr: vector | List of column names to isolate.\n  #'\n  #' Returns: :data.frame:\n  ## Set all columns to NULL except those to keep.\n  dataf[,setdiff(colnames(dataf),cols)] <- NULL\n  return(dataf)\n}\n\nrenormalise_extract_cols <- function(dataf,cols){\n  #' Isolate desired columns from a composition dataframe and renormalize the isolated columns to row-wise sum to 1.\n  #'\n  #' dataf | :data.frame: | Dataframe with a set of columns that encompasses those in cols.\n  #' cols | :chr: vector | List of column names to isolate.\n  #'\n  #' Returns: :data.frame:\n  ## Isolate the desired columns.\n  dataf <- extract_cols(dataf,cols)\n  ## Renormalize row totals to 1 (via row_1_col_1/sum(row_1)).\n  dataf <- dataf %>% ungroup %>% mutate(across(everything())/rowSums(across(everything())))\n  return(dataf)\n}\n\nPCA_compositions <- function(dataf,keep_only=c(\"SiO2\",\"MgO\",\"FeO\",\"Fe2O3\"),legend_loc=\"topleft\"){\n  #' Perform PCA on selected components within a composition dataframe, and produce a plot of the results (PC1 vs PC2).\n  #' Note: To avoid the error of ridiculousness (\"n <= p -- you can't be serious!\"), need to get rid of columns until there's (n_samples-1) left.
